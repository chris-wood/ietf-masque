## Questions to Answer

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5434

- Is there is a problem that needs solving, and the IETF is the right
group to attempt solving it?

- Is there is a critical mass of participants willing to work on the
problem (e.g., write drafts, review drafts, etc.)?

- Is the scope of the problem is well defined and understood, that
is, people generally understand what the WG will work on (and
what it won't) and what its actual deliverables will be?

- Is there is agreement that the specific deliverables (i.e.,
proposed documents) are the right set?

- It is believed that the WG has a reasonable probability of
having success (i.e., in completing the deliverables in its
charter in a timely fashion)?

## Questions/Issues Raised

- Does this change the QUIC security model? (Removing one layer of encryption when there's three parties involved?)
  - There's much confusion about layering and tunnel encryption. Let's draw some diagrams to clarify?
- Enterprise proxy and client trust issue(s)?
