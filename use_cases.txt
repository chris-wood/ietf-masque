Subject: Call for MASQUE use cases

~~~

The core MASQUE protocol [1] describes a simple negotiation mechanism for various 
applications. However, it omits use cases for these applications. MASQUE obfuscation
in support of a "hidden VPN" service is one use case [2]. Tunneling QUIC is another [3].

Given that MASQUE will be useful insofar as it addresses important use cases, I think 
it'd be useful to discuss these application use cases in more detail before Vancouver.
To that end, let's use this time before the meeting to discuss them! I'd like to ask
interested parties to please surface use cases they know of (and care about!). 

Thanks!
Chris
