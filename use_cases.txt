Subject: MASQUE Use Cases

~~~

The core MASQUE protocol [1] describes a simple negotiation mechanism for various 
applications. However, it omits use cases for these applications. MASQUE obfuscation
in support of a "hidden VPN" service is one use case [2]. Tunneling QUIC is another [3].
Given that MASQUE will be useful insofar as it addresses important use cases, I think 
it'd be useful to discuss these application use cases in more detail before Vancouver.

Let's start with QUIC proxying. This seems like a farily non-controversial use case with
numerous benefits: client IP address hiding, multiplexed stream and datagram support, 
and the opportunity to extend this arbitrarily for multi-hop circuits (Tor is doing 
similar exporations [4]). These seem to differentiate MASQUE from prior protocols, such 
as HTTP Connect and TURN. Perhaps we can expand on these differences in [1]? Or, better 
yet, could we pull this out into a separate document that builds on [1]? 

Service obfuscation and PEP support are other use cases folks have expressed interest in.
Given that MASQUE is sufficiently extensible, it supports these as extension, and they 
need not be a primary use case.
